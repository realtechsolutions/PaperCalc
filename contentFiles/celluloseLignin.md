Cellulose  is a high molecular weight, stereo-regular, and linear polymer of repeating beta-D-glucopyranose units.  
Simply speaking it is the chief structural element and major constituents of the cell wall of trees and plants.

Hemicellulose is a constituent of woods that is, like cellulose, a polysaccharide, but less complex and easily hydrolysable.  

Lignin is a complex constituent of the wood that cement the cellulose fibers together. Lignin is brown in color. Lignin is largely responsible for the
strength and rigidity of plants, but its presence in paper is believed to contribute to chemical degradation. To a large extent, lignin can be removed
during manufacturing.
