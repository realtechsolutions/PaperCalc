Tensile strength is maximum stress to break a paper sheet.  
It is one of the most important physical properties of paper and paperboard .  

Generally tensile strength of materials is expressed in terms of load per unit area but in case of paper it is generally expressed as
load per unit width of specimen.  

There are several types of tensile testers used in paper industry.but the basic principle of all is same.
### Test Method:
- First paper sample is cut in pieces of 25 mm wide and then clamped in Tensile testing machine.
- The machine is then started and the load at which
paper breaks is noted down as Tensile strength in kN/meter.
