Pulp solution viscosity gives an indication of  degree of polymerisation of cellulose.  
Therefore it gives indication of degradation of cellulose resulting from pulping and bleaching
operations.
## Test Method: 
- Take 0.250g  OD pulp in a dissolving bottle and add 25 ml dist.water shake the bottle to mix the pulp.
- Add 25 ml of cupriethylenediamine solution.
- Purge with nitrogen for  one minute and shake for about 15 minutes.
- Place the solution in viscometer and measure time in sec.
  
Calculate viscosity by formula 
$$ V = C\times t \times d $$ 
Where V is viscosity in cP C is viscometer const. and t is effux time.
