Total hardness is defined as sum of calcium and magnesium concentrations expressed as CaCO<sub>3</sub> in mg/l. 
### Test Method:</b> 
- Take 100 ml sample in conical flask add 2-3 drops Erichrome black indicator  
- Titrate with 0.5 N EDTA solution.
- Total hardness is calculated as
  $$ \frac {V \times N\times50000}{\text{Sample volume}} $$   
where 
V is beurette reading,and N is normality of EDTA solution.
