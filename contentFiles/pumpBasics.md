A pump can be defined as a machine that increases the total energy of a liquid this means that pump transfers mechanical energy to a fluid  and
converts it to pressure energy of fluid.  
Generally pumps are of two types Centrifugal pump and positive displacement pumps.  

Centrifugal pumps are suitable for low pressure high liquid flow rate applications.  

Positive displacement pumps are suitable for high pressure low flow rate applications.  

Centrifugal pumps require priming whereas PD pumps do not require priming.  

All pumps have three parts,  

1. Suction
2. Pump casing
3. Delivery.

In centrifugal pumps pump casing contains an impeller which rotates at very high rpm and increases the kinetic energy of liquid in the outer side of
pump casing,this creates a partial vacuum at the center of casing and fluid is sucked in through suction pipe.  
The increased kinetic energy in converted to pressure in the outlet pipe of pump.

In Positive displacement pump, there are two valves one on suction side and one on delivery side.  
The pump casing has a mechanism to suck liquid from suction side and deliver to delivery side,the mechanism is different in reciprocating PD pump and rotating PD pump.  

In reciprocating pump the mechanism include one cylinder and piston connected to motor by a connecting rod.In one cycle the piston movement create  suction pressure and liquid is sucked in.
In other cycle movement  the piston  compress the liquid and  the liquid is discharged through delivery pipe.  

In rotary PD pump the mechanism consists of rotating gears in case of gear pumps and rotating screw in case of screw pumps.
