BOD or Biochemical oxygen demand of polluted water is the amount of oxygen required for the biological
decomposition of dissolved organic matter under aerobic condition usually at 20\u2070 in 5 days.  

Biochemical oxygen demand is an important water quality parameter because it provides an index to assess the effect, discharged wastewater
will have on the receiving  environment.  

Depletion of DO causes stress on aquatic organisms, making the environment unsuitable for life.
BOD is similar to COD, however BOD is more specific since it measures organic matter that can be oxidised biologically.  

The BOD is used in measuring waste loadings to treatment plants and measuring efficiency of treatment plants in terms of BOD.
