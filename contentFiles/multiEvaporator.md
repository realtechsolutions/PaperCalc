An evaporator is a heat exchanger where liquid solution is concentrated by evaporating liquid.
In a single effect evaporator the solution is heated with steam. Steam condensate and liquid vapours are removed and concentrated liquid is collected.

In a single effect evaporator if the feed is at its boiling temperature theoretically 1 kg steam will be required for evaporating 1 kg water.

This is the maximum efficiency possible in a single effect evaporators.

However this efficiency can be increased by using an arrangement where evaporated vapours of liquid can be used as heating medium.
This is possible by connecting many evaporator.

First evaporator is heated by steam and other are heated by vapours of liquid. This is possible only when boiling point of feed is different in all
evaporators.

This is achieved by using vacuum system by ejectors or vacuum pumps.

Many types of feed arrangements are used in these evaporators like forward feed where Feed is introduced in first evaporators and heated with steam.
reverse feed where feed is introduced in the last effect.Mixed Feed where feed is introduced in the middle and parrallel feed where feed is introduced
in all evaporators.
