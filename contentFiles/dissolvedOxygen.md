Dissolved Oxygen of Water is ml of Sodium thiosulphate of 0.025N consumed for titrating 200 ml of sample.  

The test is known as Winkler  test method.
###  Test method:
1. Take sample in a 300 ml BOD bottle.
2. Add 2ml MnSO<sub>4</sub> and 2 ml Alkali iodide azide solution to precipipate dissolved oxygen.
3. Shake bottles and add 2 ml conc. sulphuric acid to dissolve precipitates.
4. Take 201 ml solution in to a conical flask from 300 ml bottle.
5. Titrate this solution with standard sodium thiosulphate(0.025N) using starch indicator till color changes.
6. DO = ml of Sodium thiosulphate consumed.
