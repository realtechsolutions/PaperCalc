Wet-end chemistry has a very important role in papermaking process. It is the study of the slurry of fibres ,fillers and additives.

The surface of cellulosic fibers,fillers and additives is negatively charged i.e. anionic and the level of charge is different in different materials.

In acidic conditions of papermaking  low pH (4-5) is maintained using high dose of Alum.In this condition all the fibers,fines and additives
becomes positively charged. 

In alkaline papermaking conditions  pH  of more than 7 is maintained.  
All the fibers and additives have negative charge on their surface   in alkaline
conditions.  
This high charge create a state of highly dispersed slurry difficult to drain and retain on wire.

To agglomerate particles in this slurry we have to reduce this negative charge with cationic additives like cationic polymers,coagulants,PAC,
Alum etc.
These agglomerated particles then can be retained on wire and water can easily drain from the slurry.

Surface charge on fibers,fines and fillers is determined by measuring a potential called zeta potential or electrokinetic potential.


This potential is measured in mV.   
However this potential  is not very useful to paper-maker.   What is actually useful is how much cationic chemical is
required to reduce this potential to near zero values.   
This parameter is called charge demand and is measured in mili equivalents of charge required per liter or meq/l.  
This parameter gives an indication of use of cationic chemicals in case charge demand is very high.

The above is a thumb rule and the concept of charge and charge demand is actually complex and depends on many parameters.

Some modern machines have online particle charge analysers installed on them.

Generally charge monitoring is done to improve retention and  drainage on wire.

However,since there are others factors also that affect retention and drainage, charge analysis is used in combination with others parameters.

Following is the list of commonly used additives at wet-end.

- Alum and PAC: Used for pH control and as drainage and retention aid.
- Dyes: For desired color in paper.
- Defoamers:Foam control in pulp mill and paper machine.
- Drainage aid & Retention aid:Used for drainage control and retention control.
- Slime control

- Optical Brighteners:Brightness improvement of paper
- Sizing Chemicals Rosin,AKD,ASA etc:
Control liquid penetration in paper.
-Fillers clay, CaCO<sub>3</sub>
Improve opacity,printing surface
- Dry strength resin:
Improve paper strength
