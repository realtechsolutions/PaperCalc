Tearing Strength of paper is resistance of paper to tearing force it is subjected to.  
It is a basic physical property of paper and paperboard.  
It is measured in both machine  and cross directions.  
Tear factor of paper is calculated as tearing strength per unit basis weight.
### Test Method: 
- Clamp 8-16 no. of plies of paper in Elemendrof tester.
- Start the tester.
- Note down the scale reading.
- Calculate tearing strength in mN = 16*avg scale reading/no. of plies.
