title : Activated sludge process
---

For waste water treatment paper mills generally use activated sludge process.
In this process microorganisms use organic contaminants of waste water as their food.

These microorganisms are maintained in aeration basin with controlled conditions like oxygen and food for these microorganisms.
Oxygen is maintained by continuously supplying air through agitators or diffusers.


Following are the steps of the process
1. Screening and pumping of effluent.

2. Grit removal

3. Primary Settling:
  It is done in large clarifier tanks and
  the settled sludge is removed.

4. Aeration/Activated Sludge:
  In this step contamintants are
  removed by biological activity
  of sludge.

5. Secondary Clarifier:


6. Sludge traetment:
  Sludge is dewatered using belt press
  or centrifuges.
