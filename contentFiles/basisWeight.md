title : Basis weight,caliper and bulk

### Basis weight 
Basis weight is weight in grams of a single sheet of area 1 m<sup>2</sup>. 

In papermaking process basis weight of paper is controlled by regulating stock flow to headbox or by controlling the consistency of stock to  
headbox by a control valve called basis weight control valve.  

Basis weight in paper is controlled in both cross direction and in machine direction.   
In machine direction it is controlled by proper operations of
fan pump ,basis weight valve and centricleaners.  

In cross direction it is controlled by slice lip adjustments and by using octopus flow systems.

Basis weight is an important factor in determining the quality and price of paper.It is used to classify paper into different grades, such as bond, book, and cover.   

The higher the basis weight, the thicker and heavier the paper will be.  
Bulk is another important factor in determining the quality of paper. 
 
### Caliper 
Caliper is thickness of
single sheet of paper measured in mm or micrometer.   

It is measured by micrometer.

Caliper an important factor in determining the stiffness and folding properties of paper.  

The caliper of paper can vary depending on the type of paper and the manufacturing process used to produce it.   

### Bulk  
Bulk is defined as thickness/basis weight and its unit is cc/g. Bulk is a structural property of paper.

 
It is used to describe the thickness of paper relative to its weight.  

A higher bulk means that the paper is thicker and more substantial.

### Test method 
Basis weight of paper is tested as per Tappi test method T410.
In this method first area is measured by linear measurement and then sample is weighed. The grammage is then calculated as ratio of mass to area.
Thickness is measured by using micrometer.Bulk is calculated as ratio of caliper and gsm.
