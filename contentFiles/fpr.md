First pass retention or FPR is calculated by formula,
$$
 FPR = {\frac { \text {H/B Cy % - B/W Cy % } } {\text {H/B  Cy %}}} \times100
$$ 


FPR is an important parameter for paper machine operation.
Its value should remain steady and high enough to avoid deposit and drainage problems.  
### Test Method:
- Take headbox and tray water samples at the same time.
- Measure headbox and backwater consistencies.
- Calculate FPR as per formula given above.
