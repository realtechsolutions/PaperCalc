Viscosity  is a quantity which describes a fluid's resistance to flow.   
Fluids resist the relative motion of immersed objects through them,and the motion of layers within them. 

Viscosity(represented by symbol η) is the ratio of shearing stress(F/A) to the velocity gradient (dv/dz) in a fluid. 

$$  η = \frac {(F/A)}  {(dv_x/dz)} $$  

The above equation can also be written as 
$$ F/A= \frac {η dv_x} { dz} $$

This relationship is known as newton's equation.  Viscosity is temperature dependent and is almost always stated with
temperature.  

The viscosity of water at 20<sup>0C</sup> is 1.0020 millipascal seconds which is close to one.  

As per above equation shear stress in fluids is viscosity multiplied by velocity gradient.  

The fluids which have constant viscosity at all shear forces are called newtonian fluids.  

For non newtonian fluids viscosity is not constant and it depends on shear force.  

water is an example of newtonian fluid and toothpaste is an example of nonnewtonian fluid.

For non newtonian fluids newtons equation is written as $$ \frac {F} {A} = { k ( \frac {dv_x} { dz})^n} $$

Depending on n fluids are classified as follows,
- n < 1	    pseudo plastic 
- n = 1	    newtonian 
- n > 1     dilatant  
 
The most common unit of viscosity is the dyne second per square centimeter
[dyne s/cm<sup>2</sup>], which is given the name poise [P].
