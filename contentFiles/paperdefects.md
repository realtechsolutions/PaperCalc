For solving paper defect problems, first type of defect is confirmed like holes,cracks,spots etc,then frequency is observed.

If defects are appearing continuously then it is a likely a problem of machine pumps rolls,wire,felt etc.  

If  defects are appearing occasionally then it could be a problem of additives preparation system.

Following are most common defects.
              
#### Air Bubbles:  
Caused by too much water in paper.

Pin holes are small holes caused by foreign particles.
#### Piping: 
Defects in reels consists of ridges due to moisture take up by surface layers.
#### Wrinkles:
