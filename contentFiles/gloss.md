Gloss is an important aspect of visual perception of objects. The perception of gloss can relate to a productâ€™s finish, texture and how a
sample is illuminated and viewed.

Surfaces with high reflectance are perceived as glossy, whilst less reflective surfaces are perceived as semi-gloss or matt.

Gloss can be measured by several different techniques. One of them is by using an optical instrument called a gloss meter.
A gloss meter measures gloss  in units (GU).

Gloss is measured by directing a constant intensity light beam, at a fixed angle, on to the test surface and then monitoring the amount of
reflected light from the same angle.
This specular reflectance is measured using a gloss meter,generally gloss measurement is done at 75<sup>0</sup> for paper and paperboard.

### Test Method: 
 
Tappi T480 is generally used for testing gloss of paper and paperboard.
1. Calibrate the equipment.
2. Place the conditioned sample in the tester.  
   
Report average of two three readings.
