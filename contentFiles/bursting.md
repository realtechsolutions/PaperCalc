title : Bursting strength
---

Bursting strength is measured as the maximum hydrostatic pressure required to rupture the sample by constantly increasing the pressure applied through a rubber diaphgram on 30.5 mm diameter sample.  

Bursting strength tells how much pressure a paper can tolerate before rupture.  

Equipment used for testing Burst factor  is called Mullen Tester. 

Burst factor is given by the expression BF = Bursting Strength /GSM  
where Bursting strength unit is g/cm<sup>2</sup> and gsm is g/m<sup>2</sup>.      

Burst factor is an important parameter for packaging grades of paper.


Bursting strength indicates a composite of  strength and toughness.      
It is useful in packaging grades of paper where paper is subjected to a stress similar to that exerted in Burst test.   
After every 100 readings equipment is calibrated using aluminum foil and after every 500 readings  or six months whichever is earlier diaphragm
is replaced.    

### Test Method 

First condition paper at 27 degree centigrade and 65% Relative humidity.  
Place the sample over diaphgram and clamp it.   
Start the equipment and record pressure at which paper ruptured.  
Calculate BF as per formula given above.
