Relative humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air expressed as the percentage of amount needed for saturation at the same temperature.  

Humidity is an important parameters in printing industry,because paper is a hygroscopic material and absorbs moisture from atmosphere.


Humidity is calculated by noting dry and wet bulb temperatures and using psychometric charts.  

It can be calculated as 
$$
RH \text { (\%)} = Ew-N(1+0.00115 \times Tw) \times (Td-Tw)\times 100/Ed
$$


where Ew is 
$$6.112 e^ (17.502+Td)/240.97+Tw) $$

and Ed is 
$$
6.112e^ ((17.502+Td)/240.97+Tw) )) $$ 
Td is dry bulb temperature and Tw is wet bulb temperature.
