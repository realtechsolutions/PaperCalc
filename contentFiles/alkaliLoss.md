Alkali Loss is the amount of residual alkali in pulp after washing of pulp.  

It is measured by titrating with a acid until pH changes abruptly.  

   
Formula for calculation,   

$$ \text {Alkali Loss} = \frac  {A\times N \times 40}  {\text{Sample weight}} $$  


         
where A is burette reading and N is normality of acid.
