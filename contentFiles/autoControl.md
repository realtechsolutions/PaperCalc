title : Automatic process control
---


To achieve a certain level of economy,safety and consistency  of operations almost all continuous process plants use some kind of automatic process control method.


 It enables small number of operators to manage complex processes.


Its application ranges from temperature,level control of single process to control of entire plant with thousands of control loop.


The fundamental block of any control system is control loop which controls one process.<br>
Large process plants can have thousands of control loop independent or interacting with other loops.


A control loop consists of a process sensor,controller mechanism,and final control element.

In the example above a controller compares level of tank as given by sensor with set point and then based on error  send signal to  a valve to keep the level at set point.
Commonly used controllers are PLC, DCS etc </br>
Also see PID controller tuning,PLC, DCS.
