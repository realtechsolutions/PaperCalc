Porosity is air resistance of paper.  
It is indirect measure of fluid permeability in to paper and other structural parameters.

This method measures amount of time required for a certain volume of air to pass through a test specimen.  
The air pressure is generated by a gravity loaded cylinder that captures
an air volume within a chamber using a liquid seal.  
The pressurised volume of air is passed through the paper to atmosphere.
#### Test Method: 
1. First prepare sample for testing
2. Place sample in Gurley tester between cylinder and gasket.
3. Lift the cylinder.
4. Set the timer.
5. As the cylinder falls down note  down the time till cylinder reaches from 150 ml mark to 250 ml mark.
