Brightness is a measurement of  reflectance of blue light  of wavelength 457nm.Tappi standard and ISO standards are commonly used for brightness
measurement.  
A 95  bright paper reflects more light than an 85 bright paper, therefore appearing brighter.

Using the specific blue light to measure this reflection ignores longer wavelengths, including green and red.  
Because of this,two types of paper with the same brightness can visually appear very different, even though their brightness is the same.

Whiteness measures  reflectance of all wavelengths of light across visible spectrum,   
Because of this, the whiteness measure is more in line with our visual perception.

The most common whiteness measure, D65 illumination,represents outdoor daylight.

This standard is called CIE Whiteness and was developed by the French-based International Commission on Illumination (also abbreviated CIE).

In theory a material that perfectly reflects all light energy at every visible wavelength is called perfectly white.

Shade is measurement of  color of paper.
CIE L*a*b model is used for color measurement.  
L value is a measure of lightness along black white axis,a value is measure of red green and b value is a measure of blue/yellow.
