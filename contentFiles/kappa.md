Kappa number is volume (in ml) of 0.1 N potassium permanganate solution consumed by 1 g of pulp.

### Test method:

- Take 2 g OD pulp in a beaker disintegrate it in about 500 ml water. 
- Place it on water bath and make total volume 800 ml then add 100ml KMnO<sub>4 </sub> +100ml sulphuric acid.
- Make total volume 1000 ml after 10 minutes stop reaction by adding  20 ml KI.
- Titrate free iodine with sodium thiosulphate solution using starch indicator.

- Carry out a blank test without pulp.

- calculate Kappa number 
  $$ k =  \frac {p \times f}{w} $$
  where,  

 $$  p= \frac { \text {( b-a)} \times N} {0.1} $$

Here f is correction factor which is 1.0 when consumption of permeate is 50%.,b is amount of thiosulphate consumed in blank, a is
thiosulphate consumed by sample N is normality of thiosulphate.
