title : Conditioning of paper
---


Paper is hygroscopic in nature ie it is capable of absorbing water from surroundings atmosphere.  

Amount of absorbed water depends on humidity and temperature of air in contact with paper, hence even slight changes in humidity and temperature affect test results.

So it is necessary to maintain standard conditions during testing of paper.
Under Tappi standard all tests are carried out at 23<sup>0</sup>C+- 1 and 50+-2 % relative humidity.


Conditioning of paper is the process of exposing paper or paper products to a controlled environment of temperature and humidity for a specified period of time before testing or using them.  

This is done to ensure that the paper has reached a state of equilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere and that its physical and mechanical properties are stable and consistent.  

Conditioning of paper is important for several reasons:
- It eliminates the effects of moisture variations on the paper properties, such as tensile strength, stiffness, curl, and dimensional stability.
- It ensures the accuracy and reliability of the test results and the performance of the paper products in different applications and environments.
- It enables the comparison of paper samples from different sources, batches, or locations under the same conditions.  
- It complies with the international standards and specifications for paper testing and quality control.  
 
Conditioning of paper is done by following the standard procedures and guidelines established by various organizations, such as ASTM, ISO, TAPPI, etc.  


Some of the common steps involved in conditioning of paper are:
- Selecting a suitable conditioning chamber or room that can maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity within the specified range and tolerance.
- Preparing the paper samples by cutting, weighing, marking, or stacking them as required by the test method or the product specification.
- Placing the paper samples in the conditioning chamber or room and leaving them undisturbed for the required duration, usually 24 hours or more.
- Removing the paper samples from the conditioning chamber or room and transferring them to the testing or using area without exposing them to any drastic changes in temperature or humidity.
- Conducting the tests or using the paper products as soon as possible after conditioning, preferably within 4 hours.
