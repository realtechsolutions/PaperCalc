The Schopper degree test is designed to provide a measure of the rate at which a dilute suspension of pulp may be dewatered.  

One <sup>0</sup>SR corresponds to 10 ml of water. 

The Schopper-Riegler Freeness Tester is a specialized instrument used in the paper and pulp industry.  

Its purpose is to determine the degree of refining (beating) of a pulp suspension in water and express it in terms of the SR number.
Additionally, it helps assess the dewatering time of the pulp.

The Schopper-Riegler test provides a measure of how quickly a dilute suspension of pulp can be dewatered.  

It correlates with surface conditions, fiber swelling, and the mechanical treatment the pulp has undergone.  
The test is applicable to various types of pulp in aqueous suspension.  

### Test Procedure:
- The operator takes 2 grams of pulp, dilutes it in one liter of water, and pours it into the fill chamber.
- The fill chamber is then closed by a conical nipple.
- Upon pressing the start button, the conical nipple is lifted pneumatically, and - the suspension discharges.
- The fibers are retained while the filtrate drains.
- The drainage time depends on the composition of the fiber suspension.
- The filtrate flows into a measuring beaker through a lateral outlet.
- The freeness is expressed in Schopper-Riegler degrees (°SR).

The SR degree describes the amount of drained suspension and represents the drainage properties of the diluted pulp.  

Water hardness and temperature significantly influence the results.  
Consistent water hardness and a temperature of 20°C are crucial for accurate measurements.  

The most reliable results fall within the range of 10 to 90 SR number.  
Extremely short-fibered pulps (such as those from well-beaten hardwoods)
may not yield accurate results due to insufficient mat formation on the wire screen.   

The SR test is not recommended for certain extremely short-fibered pulps.
It does not necessarily correlate with the drainage behavior of pulp on a commercial paper machine.  

While this test provides valuable insights into pulp properties, it’s essential to consider its limitations and use it in conjunction with other relevant tests for a comprehensive assessment.
