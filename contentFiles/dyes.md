Following types of dyes are used in papermaking.  

1. Direct Dyes: 
These are most common colorants for paper. They have a highly conjugated planer structure with anionic charge due to presence of sulphonate groups.
They are called Direct because they have enough affinity to stick to fiber surface that no fixative is required.

2. Basic dyes: 
They are low molecular weight cationic charged molecules.They are used in highly anionic furnishes.
3. Acid Dyes: 
 They are low molecular weight anionic charged molecules . They are not very useful to paper-maker.
4. Pigment Dyes:
 They are insoluble coloured pigments.They are used where high light-fastness is required.
 They are like filler particles which have to be retained in sheet.
