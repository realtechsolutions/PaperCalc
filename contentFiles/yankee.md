It is a type of fourdnier machine which employs a single dryer of very large circumference with highly polished surface. 

A Yankee dryer is a crucial component in the production of machine-glazed (MG) and tissue paper.

It serves as a pressure vessel that plays a pivotal role in the papermaking process.

The primary function of the Yankee dryer is to remove excess moisture from the pulp.

The paper enters the Yankee dryer at approximately 42–45% dryness and exits at over 89% dryness.
Unlike other paper production methods that use a series of drying cylinders, tissue production relies on a single cylinder called the Yankee cylinder.

One of the important features  of the Yankee dryer is its ability to create a creped surface on one side of the paper.

Creeping involves imparting a crinkled texture to the paper.
The Yankee cylinder is equipped with a doctor blade, which scrapes the dry paper off the cylinder surface.

This action results in the desired creeping effect.  
The degree of crinkle (creeping) depends on several factors:
- Adhesive strength
- Doctor blade geometry
- Speed difference: Between the  Yankee and the final section of the paper machine.
- Paper pulp characteristics

In tissue production, only one cylinder,the Yankee cylinder dries the paper.

This is possible due to the low grammage (gsm) of tissue paper (typically in the range of 14-45 gsm).

Some machines may have a few additional drying cylinders after the Yankee for higher gsm tissue products (referred to as “wet creping”).

Yankee cylinders are traditionally made of cast iron and can have diameters up to 6 meters.  
However, newer machines often use steel yankees, which are lighter and easier to produce and transport.
Due to the abrasive effect of the creeping blade, the Yankee’s surface becomes irregular and rough over time.  

Cast iron yankees require periodic grinding or polishing to maintain their surface quality.

To prevent shell thickness reduction, a metallization process is sometimes applied. A special Chrom-Nickel alloy is sprayed onto the surface, enhancing abrasion resistance.

The metallised surface withstands wear, reducing the need for frequent polishing.
