Stiffness is a measure of flexural rigidity of paper.  

It is bending moment(g-cm or mNm) required to deflect the free end of a 1.5 inch wide vertically clamped sample 150 from its center line when
load is applied 50 mm away from the clamp.  

It is measured in MD and CD.
### Test Method
- Place the conditioned sample in the vise of tester.
- Align the sample with the center line of pendulum of equipment.
- Start the  motor to deflect sample to 15<sup>0</sup> mark in the left side.
- Stop the motor and record scale reading.
- Take similar reading by deflecting sample to the right side.
- Calculate bending moment as average of above two readings.
