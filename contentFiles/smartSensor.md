### **Applications of Smart Sensors in Papermaking**
1. **Condition Monitoring**:
    - Monitor the health of critical components like rolls, bearings, felts, and press sections.
    - Detect issues like misalignment, wear, or bearing failure before they lead to breakdowns.

2. **Moisture Control**:
    - Measure moisture content in the paper sheet at different stages (forming, press, and drying sections).
    - Optimize water removal and reduce energy consumption in the drying process.

3. **Temperature Monitoring**:
    - Track cylinder temperatures in the drying section to ensure uniform drying and prevent defects.

4. **Vibration Analysis**:
    - Identify abnormal vibrations in rotating equipment (rolls, fans, pumps), indicating potential mechanical issues.

5. **Felt and Wire Monitoring**:
    - Sensors embedded in felts or wires detect wear, contamination, and tension, helping maintain optimal performance.

6. **Sheet Profile Measurement**:
    - Analyze sheet thickness, basis weight, and moisture profile to ensure product consistency and quality.

7. **Energy Optimization**:
    - Monitor steam, electricity, and compressed air usage for efficient resource management.

8. **Environmental Compliance**:
    - Track emissions, effluent levels, and air quality to meet regulatory requirements.
