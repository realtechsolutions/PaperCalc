About 1.1-1.4 kg water per kg of paper is removed in the dryer section of Paper machine.  

Steam consumption ranges from 1.5-2.5 kg steam/kg paper.  

Paper is dried in cast iron cylinders which is a type of pressure vessel where steam is pushed and condensate water is removed through
siphoning mechanism.  
Syphons are of two types  stationary and rotating.  
Condensate water coming out of dryers also contains some amount of steam.   

There are three types of condensate removal systems.
-  Trap Based. 
-   Cascade system. 
- Thermocompressor based blow thru systems. 

In trap based system steam traps are installed in the cylinder.   These traps are not suitable for high speed machines with rotary siphons and
high differential pressure.  

Cascade system is installed in medium to high speed machines.   In this system blow through steam of one section
is cascaded to previous dryer section.  
In this system steam pressure in dryer sections is dependent on header pressure.   
Dryer group pressure depends on other group pressures.    

In thermocompressor based systems low pressure flash steam is boosted using thermocompressor system.   Recompressed steam is recirculated in the dryers.  
In this system each dryer section is operated independently depending on temperature profile of group.
