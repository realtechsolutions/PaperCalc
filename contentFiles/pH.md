pH is a scale used  to specify acidity or basicity  of an aqueous solution.


Acidic Solutions have pH less than 7 and basic solutions have pH more than 7.

The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicate the hydrogen ion concentration.

It is expressed as pH = - log [H+].

pH of any solution is temperature dependent so if pH of a solution is 7 at 25 degree celcius it will be slightly less than 7 at higher  temperature.
