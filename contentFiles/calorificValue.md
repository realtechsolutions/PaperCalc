title : Calorific value of coal
---

Coal is mostly used in power plants for electricity generation.  
Energy released on burning of coal is known as calorific value.  
It is of two types Gross calorific value(GCV) and net calorific value(NCV).  
GCV is total heat released by combustion of a given amount of fuel.It also   include the energy of exhaust gases and water vapour produced during
reaction.  

NCV does not include energy of byproducts of combustion. So NCV = GCV-latent heat of vapours.

GCV is measured by a bomb calorimeter which works on the principal that heat released by combustion of fuel is absorbed within calorimeter
fluid and temperature of calorimeter fluid rises.

GCV = Heat Capacity of calorimeter water × ΔT

Heat capacity of calorimeter water is mass of water in gram  multiplied by 4.184 joule.

With bomb calorimeter a few correction are made to above equations.  
1. Correction for energy released by combustion of fuse wire.
2. Nonadiabaticity of calorimeter, a bomb calorimeter is only approximately adiabatic.

Calorific value of coal is generally  measured as per IS:1350 standard.

### Test Method:

1. Load sample attach a cotton thread to fuse.
2. Load the capsule in bomb and screw cap.
3. Connect oxygen supply.
4. Carefully put the assembly in calorimeter with thermometer assembly.
5. Start calorimeter and note the rise of temperature and final temp. 6.Calculate as per formula if calorimeter is not automatic.
