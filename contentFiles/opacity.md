Opacity of paper indicates resistance of paper to passage of light.  

This property is useful in book printing where both sides of the paper are printed.
### Test method:
First  measure brightness of paper by backing paper sample with black-sheet of paper.

Then measure brightness of paper by backing  paper sample with thick pile of same paper.

Opacity is the ratio of these figures.
