A centricleaner is a conical or partly cylindrical device with no moving part,designed to remove grit and heavier particles from stock by centrifugal
action of rotating fluid.  
Stock furnish is fed into the hydro cyclone tangentially under a certain pressure.
This creates a centrifugal movement,pushing the heavier phase outward and downward alongside the wall of the conical part. The decreasing diameter in
the conical part increases the speed and so enhances the separation.  
Finally, the concentrated solids are discharged through the apex.                   
The vortex finder in the overflow part creates a fast rotating upward spiral movement of the fluid in the centre of the conically shaped housing. The fluid is
discharged through the overflow outlet.

Centricleaners and hydrocyclones are both types of centrifugal cleaners that are used in the pulp and paper industry to remove contaminants from pulp slurries.

Centricleaners are high-density cleaners that use centrifugal force to separate heavy contaminants from the pulp slurry.

Hydrocyclones, on the other hand, use centrifugal force to separate particles or droplets from a liquid medium.

Centricleaners are typically used in the first stage of the cleaning process, where they remove heavy contaminants such as sand, glass, and metal particles from the pulp slurry.

The pulp slurry is fed into the cleaner, where it is spun at high speeds. The heavy contaminants are then thrown to the outside of the cleaner by centrifugal force and are removed through a reject port.
The cleaned pulp is then discharged through the accept port and sent to the next stage of the cleaning process.

Hydrocyclones are used in the later stages of the cleaning process to remove fine particles from the pulp slurry.
The slurry is fed into the hydrocyclone tangentially under a certain pressure, creating a centrifugal movement that pushes the heavier phase outward and downward alongside the wall of the conical part.

The decreasing diameter in the conical part increases the speed and enhances the separation.      
Finally, the concentrated solids are discharged through the apex, while the fluid is discharged through the overflow outlet.

Both centricleaners and hydrocyclones are important tools in the pulp and paper industry for removing contaminants from pulp slurries.  
They are highly efficient and effective at removing contaminants of different sizes and densities, which helps to improve the quality of the final product.
