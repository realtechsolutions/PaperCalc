The kraft process is the dominant pulping process in the  paper industry because it can handle variety of raw materials and about 95% of chemicals
can be recovered with the generation of steam.

The purpose of the chemical recovery cycle is to recover cooking liquor chemicals from spent cooking liquor.   
The process involves concentrating
black liquor, combusting organic compounds, reducing inorganic compounds, and reconstituting cooking liquor.

The cooking liquor also known as white liquor is solution of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S.During pulping operation it is converted to weak black liquor of
about 15% concentration.

This weak black liquor is sent to evaporators( See multiple effect evaporators) where it is concentrated to about 50% concentration.  
This liquor is then burned in boilers.

Molten inorganic salts are collected from the bottom of boiler and then dissolved in water to generate green liquor.

Green liquor contains mainly Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> , Na<sub>2</sub>S and some unburnt carbon.   
The Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub> is converted to NaOH by reacting green
liquor with lime in slakers by the reaction,    Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>+Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> â†’  2NaOH+CaCO<sub>3</sub>

This white liquor is then sent to clarifiers.   
From clarifiers the clean white liquor is sent to pulp mill and mud is sent to mud filter,mainly a rotary vacuum filter where mud is dewatered and converted to thick cake.

This cake is then sent to lime kiln where it is converted to lime CaO.
