Electric power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy, measured inwatts (W), kilowatts (kW) or horsepower (hp).  
One watt is equal to one joule per second or one newton-meter per second. One horsepower is equal to 746 watts or 550 foot-pounds per second. 

In an electric motor, the mechanical power output is defined as the product of the rotational speed (in revolutions per minute or RPM) and the torque (in pound-feet or newton-meters).  

The torque is the twisting force that makes the motor run and is active from 0% to 100% operating speed.  

The power output depends on the speed of the motor and is zero at 0% speed and normally at its maximum at operating speed.  

The efficiency of an electric motor is the ratio of the mechanical power output to the electrical power input.

The electrical power input is the product of the voltage, current and power factor of the motor.

The efficiency of a motor indicates how well it converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The higher the efficiency, the less energy is wasted as heat and the lower the operating cost.
