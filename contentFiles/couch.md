Couch Roll is a rotating, perforated metal cylinder at the end of a fourdrinier papermaking machine\'s forming section that uses a vacuum to
remove water from the wet paper web before the web is sent to the press section.  

After passing through the couch roll, the paper web is still about 80-85% water.


Couch rolls are usually made of cast iron or steel and covered with rubber or synthetic material.

The surface of the couch roll is grooved or drilled with rows of small holes, typically 4 to 5 mm in diameter, to allow water to be sucked out of the web.

The couch roll rotates at the same speed as the forming fabric and has a diameter of about 1 to 1.5 m. 

The main function of the couch roll is to remove water from the web and consolidate the sheet to strengthen it before it enters the press section.
The couch roll also serves as the final wrap where the web exits the forming fabric.  

The amount of water removed by the couch roll depends on the vacuum level, the dwell time, the web basis weight, and the couch roll cover properties.  

Couch rolls are used in various types of paper machines, such as Fourdrinier, twin-wire, and cylinder machines.  
Couch rolls are also used in paperboard machines and coating machines.  
 
Couch rolls can improve the dryness, smoothness, and strength of the paper web
