PLC is short form of Programmable Logic Controller.  

A PLC is a computer specially designed to operate reliably under harsh industrial environments.  

PLCs are used to automate industrial processes.PLCs are like personal computer.They both have a power supply,a CPU (Central Processing Unit),
inputs and outputs (I/O), memory, and operating software (although it is a different operating software).  

The biggest differences between a PLC and a PC is that PLC can accepts  continuous inputs but  a PC cannot ,and a PLC is much better suited to rough
industrial environments.  

PLCs play a crucial role in the field of automation,forming part of a larger SCADA system.  

A PLC can be programmed according to the operational requirement of the process.

PLC are generally programmed in ladder logic and C language.
