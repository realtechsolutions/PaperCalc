Calendering is the last step of the paper manufacturing process that affects paper and board properties.<br>

The main purpose of calendering is to improve the surface properties of paper and to control the caliper profile.<br>

After the paper is thinned by the calendering process, the paper goes through an additional set of calenders (super-calenders) to produce an even
smoother and glossier paper called supercalendered paper.<br>

The super calender consists of several cylinders alternating between polished metal and soft resilient surfaces.<br>

The super calender runs at high speed and applies pressure, heat, and friction to glaze both surfaces of the paper, making them
smooth and glossy.<br>
