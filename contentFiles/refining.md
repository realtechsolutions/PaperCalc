The mechanical treatment given to the fibers in water to increase surface area, flexibility and promote bonding when dried is called refining.  

One of the unintended effect of beating is fiber length reduction.
###  Effect of Degree of Beating on Paper Properties.

Properties change on increase in Beating is given below.

- Apparent Density: Increases
- Caliper: Decreases
- Compressibility: Decreases
- Dimensional Stability:Decreases
- Formation: More Uniform
- Hardness/Softness:Harder
- Ink Holdout: Becomes more
- Internal Bond Strength:Increases
- Porosity: Decreases
- Smoothness:	Increases
