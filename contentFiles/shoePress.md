The nip of a shoe press consists of a stationary shoe which is loaded against a press roll.   
A stationary concave shoe press replaces the
conventional bottom roll.  

A belt or sleeve forms the shell that runs between the mechanical press and bottom felt.   
Oil is supplied on the inside of the belt.

In press water removal depends on pressure applied and nip residence time, the product of these two parameters is called Press impulse.

In conventional roll nip residence time and pressure applied are constrained.  
In shoe press residence time is increased.
